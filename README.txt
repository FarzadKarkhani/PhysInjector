What is it?

PhysInjector is a collection of powerfull factory and wrapper classes developed to work specifically with Box2D and does not do any collision detection on its own, rather it significantly simplifies the use of Box2D within your Flash games and applications while providing an array of handy plugins and helper classes.

PhysInjector takes a totally different approach than other conventional physics libraries. Instead of you having to create a physics object and apply a display object as a skin, it actually uses display objects that have already been added to the stage and “injects” them with physics properties. You don’t have to worry about the display object’s position, scale or rotation! PhysInjector will handle that for you!
